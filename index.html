		<div id="aboutMe">
			<p id="welcome1">
			    My name is Peter and I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo. My favourite subjects are finance and computer science. Moreover, I have been coding for over 4 years, and love developing apps of all sorts. I have developed apps for PC and web, and I am currently working on developing an app for Android/iOS. You should check out my portfolio and GitHub for projects I've worked on, or if you want to have a friendly competition with your friend on who can get a better highscore in Leukocytic Defense!
			</p>
			<p id="welcome2">
				I am also pursuing the CFA and CPA designations on top of coding apps and side projects. Since I am passionate in finance, technology, and people, I hope to be part of a team that creates useful applications relevant to both fields!
			</p>
			<p id="sports">
			    I run for the University of Waterloo's Cross Country and
			    Track and Field Team. I run 8-10km races during cross 
			    country season and 800/1500/Mile/Steeplechase races 
			    during track season. Nevertheless, I compete in many
			    road races when I'm not racing with the team. For 
			    example, Yonge Street 10k, Scotiabank 5k/Half/Marathon,
			    and races in the Waterloo Running Series. I am a very 
			    open and fun guy--if you ever see me jogging, at a race, or even on campus, be sure to say hi!
